    <h2>Kaleb Schwalbe</h2>
    <p>I am from Missouri and I am pursuing a BS in computer science.</p>
    <p>My current job is in a metal shop that makes augers. I have had a lot of very different jobs wanting to figure
        out where to build a career which led me to going back to school. I hope to be able to get a job that will
        enable me to raise a family.</p>
    <p>I recently got engaged to my amazing fiance. We plan on getting married on January 7th which we are both looking
        forward to. One thing we do quite often is to go the gym. She has helped get me into much better shape than I used to be. </p>
